A repository that contains folders for every task: Find MB, find CMB - confounder, create synthetic data 

Tasks:
1. How to find the MB of a set of variables for binary and ordinal outcomes, when the independent variables are mixed,
2. How to find the Causal Markov Boundary and so if there is a confounder in your data. If there is no confounder you can use both observational and experimental data to predict the post-interventional outcome
3. Create synthetic data for both ordinal and binary data. Testing our code in synthetic data. Assuming we have only RCT data, we create observational data based on the ground truth model that RCT data entails by changing one variable and the outcome based on a hypothetical confounder(a variable that has strong correlation in RCT).
